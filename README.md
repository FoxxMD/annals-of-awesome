Annals of Awesome
=================

A very opiniated and incomplete list of libraries, projects, and articles that meet at least one of these requirements:

* **[Resource]** Code I would find handy/time-saving for my own work
* **[Watch Me]** Code that is super interesting and I want to remember it but not watch it (too many notifications)
* **[Sensei]** Best-practices in guide or article form
* **[Learning]** New concepts or areas of programming(languages, frameworks, etc.) that I want to explore

Divided by language or area of concentration and then randomly categorized. Bolded items are ones I am particularly interested in at the moment.
